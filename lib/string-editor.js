   *
   * It works by keeping a list of edit positions and edit sizes that can be
   * used to transform positions. They work kind of like a flattened set of
   * operational transforms (they can't tell you the sequence of edits or
   * exactly what changed at each step, but give you enough information to
   * translate positions). This is meant to be a little faster for our use
   * case, which is important since this is used in very hot code.
   *
   * It would be easier to keep a simple numeric offset between the length of
   * the new and the original strings, but doing so means we have to be extra
   * careful to make sure that all edits to the string happen in order. Most of
   * the time that's easy to guarantee, but in some cases, it can be hard to
   * ensure that two different check rules which may have to look at the
   * same part of the string cooperate properly so that they are in order. The
   * tools in StringEditor mean you shouldn't need to worry about that.
